# Country Info Project

This project consists of two parts: a **client** and a **server**. The client is responsible for rendering the UI and interacting with the server, which provides the necessary country data. The project uses **Next.js** for both the client and server-side logic.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to run two separate terminals â€” one for the **server** and one for the **client**. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project locally.
